### Summary
For our first project, we have decided to analyze travel data. 
We plan to use a handful of APIs that provide data on travel 
destinations, flight cost, hotel rental rates, car rental rates, 
points of interest, etc. Our goal is to provide a travel portfolio
for potential customers. The portfolio will consist of a 
dashboard where the client will be able to choose from a 
series of travel destinations based on their budget and 
interests. They’ll have information on the seasonality of trips
to the intended destination, and other tourism related data, 
as well as associated costs.
