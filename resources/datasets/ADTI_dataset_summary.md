ATDI 2020 ranks 191 countries. New in 2020, the report dives into what makes an adventure destination competitive in changing times, and it is published with a companion report: GSTC Global Destination Sustainability Report, which is designed to more deeply explore the sustainability dimension of adventure tourism competitiveness worldwide.
